# LSA_proteomics_files
Jupyter notebooks and HTML exports for proteomics analyses (univariate, multivariate, and machine learning). This repository contains the final analysis notebooks and their HTML exports used to explore and model proteomics data.

## Repository contents
- Final_Univariate_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook of the univariate statistical analysis and visualizations.  
- Final_Univariate_analysis.html: HTML export of the univariate notebook.  
- Final_Multivariate_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook of the multivariate analysis and visualizations.  
- Final_Multivariate_analysis.html: HTML export of the multivariate notebook.  
- Final_Machine_learning.ipynb: Jupyter notebook of the machine learning model and visualizations.  
- Final_Machine_learning.html: HTML export of the machine learning notebook.

> Note: Data files are not included in this repository. Open the notebooks to see the  data filenames that should be downloaded.

## Purpose
These notebooks show the workflow to test the following hypotheses:
- Final_Univariate_analysis: Is Type 2 diabetes (T2D) more prevalent in critical COVID-19 cases than non-critical cases?
- Final_Multivariate_analysis: Are STAT1.1, SAA1 and FGL1 protein abundances associated with COVID-19 severity (mild/moderate/severe/critical) after accounting for sex?
- Final_Machine_learning: To what extent can clinical and proteomic biomarkers predict the likelihood that a COVID-19 patient will progress to a critical disease state?

## Requirements
To run the notebooks, use jupyterlab (version 4.2.5, accessed via Anaconda Navigator). The required packages are stated at the beginning of each notebook or are placed before you run the code in a certain cell.
